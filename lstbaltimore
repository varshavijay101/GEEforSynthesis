////////// Case Study: Land Surface Temperature //////////////////

//This case study comes from a collaboration with 
//Dr. Tijana Jovanovic.
//Please read below for background.

/*
Dr. Tijana Jovanovic, is trained in civil and environmental engineering 
with a focus on water resources. She was a fellow postdoctoral researcher at SESYNC,
currently at the British Geological Society. Tijana is focused on the critical problem
of urban green infrastructure. Citing green infrastructure projects involves optimizing
accros multiple goals to allow for multi-functionality. In Baltimore county, 
where her study was focused, one of the goals
of green infrastructure implementation is the reduction of urban heat island effects.

This critical question impacts ecological outcomes in urban settings, human health, as well
as the management of stormwater volumes!

/*
To answer this question we use Landsat 8 data to calculate Land Surface Temperature.
First search for and import Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 Raw Images
Explore these data by printing the first image. 
To review Landsat 8 band values in greater detail than we did 
in earlier lessons refer to
https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-8/landsat-8-bands/
*/

/*
Now we will import a very useful Google Earth Engine Toolbox (GEET)
library developed by Eduardo Ribeiro Lacerda called GEET
Visit his github site https://github.com/sacridini/GEET
to add his Javascript library to your scripts

Once added we call functions in the library using the require() function.
*/

var geet = require('users/elacerda/geet:geet'); 

/*
We also need to define the study area. As we did in a 
previous lesson, draw a the study area around the city of
Baltimore. Draw an area including the surrounding areas
to better approximate the county of Baltimore.
Name geometry object.
*/

/*
Now begin processing imagery from the raw Landsat image collection
by first filtering to the least cloudy image for July 2018.
See below for a start on this.
*/

///filter raw by spatial extent, date and cloud cover
var image2 = ee.Image(
  name.filterBounds()
    .filterDate()
    .sort()//this makes sure that the first image is the least cloudy
    .first()
);

/*
Having filtered our image collection to a single image, we can
use the 
var new_toa_radiance = geet.toa_radiance(image2, 10);
var brightness_temp_img = geet.brightness_temp_l8c(new_toa_radiance, true);
var l8_ndvi = geet.ndvi_l8(brightness_temp_img); 
var img_pv = geet.prop_veg(l8_ndvi);
var lse = geet.surface_emissivity(img_pv);
var surfTemp_img = geet.surface_temperature_oli(lse);
var im = surfTemp_img.select("LST");
print(im);
Map.addLayer(im, {min: 7000, max: 8000, palette: ['blue', 'green', 'red']});
