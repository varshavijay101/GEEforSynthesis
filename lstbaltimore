//This case study comes from a collaboration with 
//Dr. Tijana Jovanovic.
//Please read below for background.

/*
Dr. Tijana Jovanovic, is trained in civil and environmental engineering 
with a focus on water resources. She was a fellow postdoctoral researcher at SESYNC,
currently at the British Geological Society. Tijana is focused on the critical problem
of urban green infrastructure. Citing green infrastructure projects involves optimizing
accros multiple goals to allow for multi-functionality. In Baltimore county, 
where her study was focused, one of the goals
of green infrastructure implementation is the reduction of urban heat island effects.

This critical question impacts ecological outcomes in urban settings, human health, as well
as the management of stormwater volumes!

/*
To answer this question we use Landsat 8 data to calculate Land Surface Temperature.
First search for and import Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 Raw Images
Explore these data by printing the first image. 
To review Landsat 8 band values in greater detail than we did 
in earlier lessons refer to
https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-8/landsat-8-bands/

/*
Now we will import a very useful GEE library developed by Eduardo Ribeiro Lacerda called GEET
Visit his github site https://github.com/sacridini/GEET
to add his Javascript library to your scripts

Once added we call functions in the library using the require() function.
