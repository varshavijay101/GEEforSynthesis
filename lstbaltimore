//This case study comes from a collaboration with 
//Dr. Tijana Jovanovic.
//Please read below for background.

/*
Dr. Tijana Jovanovic is trained in civil and environmental engineering 
with a focus on water resources. She was a fellow postdoctoral researcher at SESYNC,
currently at the British Geological Society. Tijana is focused on the critical problem
of urban green infrastructure. Citing green infrastructure projects involves optimizing
accros multiple goals to allow for multi-functionality. In Baltimore county, 
where her study was focused, one of the goals
of green infrastructure implementation is the reduction of urban heat island effects.

This critical question impacts ecological outcomes in urban settings, human health, as well
as the management of stormwater volumes!

/*
To answer this question we use Landsat 8 data to calculate Land Surface Temperature.
First search for and import Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 Raw Images
Explore these data by printing the first image. 
To review Landsat 8 band values in greater detail than we did 
in earlier lessons refer to
https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-8/landsat-8-bands/
*/

/*
Now we will import a very useful Google Earth Engine Toolbox (GEET)
library developed by Eduardo Ribeiro Lacerda called GEET
Visit his github site https://github.com/sacridini/GEET
to add his Javascript library to your scripts

Once added we call functions in the library using the require() function.

/*
We also need to define the study area. As we did in a 
previous lesson, draw a the study area around the city of
Baltimore. Draw an area including the surrounding areas
to better approximate the county of Baltimore.
Name geometry object.

Now begin processing imagery from the raw Landsat image collection
by first filtering to the least cloudy image for July 2018.
July typically contains the hottest days of the year as shown in this
National Climate Data Center analysis.

cloud cover.

Having filtered our image collection to a single image, we can
use the GEET library to process the raw image to obtain surface
reflectance values
*/

/*
Using the Landsat 8 documentation we see that bands 1-4 and 8
sense wavelengths in the visible spectrum (visible to the human eye),
band 5 senses near infared (useful for sensing vegetation), 
bands 5 and 6 short wave infared (useful for sensing wet areas),
and bands 10 and 11 for thermal infared wavelegths.

For this study we want to understand heat so we use the thermal infared
in addition to the other bands to calculate land surface temperature
*/


/*
We use the following set of functions to calculate 
land surface temperature (LST)
values as implemented in the GEET toolbox.

It should be noted that there are multiple methods used to calculate land
surface temperature for Landsat 8. This approach implements a method found
in http://www.jestr.org/downloads/Volume8Issue3/fulltext83122015.pdf

Here is an excellent GEE script by for another method
https://code.earthengine.google.com/d938f04d6a06c0049abf39d358c0c969

*hint-each function uses the output of the previous*

If green infrastructure can play a role in reducing urban heat,
then let us investigate the relationship between vegetation occurence

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI)

/*
Looking at these two images (toggle on and off and reset the stretch)
it seems that the areas with high levels of vegetation (high NDVI values)
do seem to have lower land surface temperatures.
Great job! That makes sense.

/*
Finally, lets validate our LST estimates by comparing to the
MOD11A2.006 Terra Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity 8-Day Global 1km
Search for the imagecollection and add to code editor.

We are only interested in LST so use the .select function to get the
LST_Day_1km band

MODIS LST values are scaled and stored in degrees K so we need to convert
to C to interpret the values.  We are also preserving the time of data
acquisition for later analysis.

Compare spatial resolutions of our calculated Landsat dataset and this MODIS

it is important to think about*

Based on the difference in spatial resolution we expect differences in LST
estimates between the two datasets. But what we are looking for here is a gut
check on the values we calculated.
Add the MODIS LST estimate to the map using the same palette visualization.
Use the Inspector tab on the right to click and compare values.

These values seem to be in broad agreement.  In later lessons we will use charts
to look at the correllation between values in our study region but for now 
we can agree that we have verified the Landsat LST data we produced

Finally we'll do something super fun!
We will explore temporal trends in land surface temperature in
Baltimore using the MODIS LST image collection

/*
Great job! This chart is interesting but difficult to interpret.
Given the focus of Tijana's work, a mean estimate of trends is also not
as useful as a better understanding of the variability in trends.

So, our final attempt to understand these data is to run a pixel based regression
for every pixel in our study region.
We set up a linear regression (OLS) with a single predictor variable and
constant.  We use the time aquisition date as independent variable and
the MODIS LST as the dependent variable.

To do this we create two band images where the independent variable is
contained in the first band and the dependent in the second.  We then
apply the linearFit reducer

The output of this analysis is a two band image. 
The offset contains the intercept value.
The scale contains the slope.  *Note this can be confusing because 
scale typically refers to the spatial scale of an image*

Add the model fit to the map where blue represents decreases in LST
and red increases in peak (July) LST through time (2000-present)
Apply an image stretch to make this more interpretable.

Great job! You should see some interesting trends in the variability of LST
over time.
Now, having completed this analysis we can export the processed Landsat LST
