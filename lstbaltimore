//This case study comes from a collaboration with 
//Dr. Tijana Jovanovic.
//Please read below for background.

/*
Dr. Tijana Jovanovic, is trained in civil and environmental engineering 
with a focus on water resources. She is a fellow postdoctoral researcher at SESYNC,
currently at the British Geological Society. Tijana is focused on the critical problem
of urban green infrastructure. Citing green infrastructure projects involves optimizing
accros multiple goals. In Baltimore county, where her study was focused, one of the goals
of green infrastructure implementation is the reduction of temperature.

This critical question impacts ecological outcomes in urban settings, human health, as well
as the location of stormwater volumes.

To answer this question we use Landsat 8 data to 

var geet = require('users/elacerda/geet:geet'); 
///Load Baltimore county/watershed extent
var bmore= ee.Feature(baltimore)
Map.addLayer(bmore)
///filter raw by spatial extent, date and cloud cover
var image2 = ee.Image(
  l8raw.filterBounds(baltimore)
    .filterDate('2018-07-01', '2018-7-31')///supply start end dates for imagery...this includes all images so you might want to create monthly averages etc
    .sort('CLOUD_COVER')//Pull
    .first()
);
var new_toa_radiance = geet.toa_radiance(image2, 10);
var brightness_temp_img = geet.brightness_temp_l8c(new_toa_radiance, true);
var l8_ndvi = geet.ndvi_l8(brightness_temp_img); 
var img_pv = geet.prop_veg(l8_ndvi);
var lse = geet.surface_emissivity(img_pv);
var surfTemp_img = geet.surface_temperature_oli(lse);
var im = surfTemp_img.select("LST");
print(im);
Map.addLayer(im, {min: 7000, max: 8000, palette: ['blue', 'green', 'red']});
