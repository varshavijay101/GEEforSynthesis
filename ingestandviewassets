/* The Earth Engine data catalog contains many common datasets 
but many research projects use data obtained and stored locally

In this excercise we will use data from 
Vijay, Varsha, et al. 
"Deforestation risks posed by oil palm expansion in the Peruvian Amazon." 
Environmental Research Letters 13.11 (2018): 114010.

We will use one of the datasets describing deforestation 
inside current oil palm plantations downloaded directly 
from the Oil_palm_Peru folder in the Resources section 
of the google site for this workshop

Once you download this dataset, unzip and find 4 files:
deforestoilpalmWGS.tif, deforestoilpalm.zip
deforestoilpalmWGS.zip, README
