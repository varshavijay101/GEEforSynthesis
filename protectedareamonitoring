//This case study comes my research in collaboration

//Please read below for background.

/*
One of my overarching research interests is the impact of anthropogenic
impacts on species and habitat loss. I have investigated this question at
varying spatiotemporal scales and extents.  For this case study I want to
focus on two contiguous protected areas in India and Bhutan: Manas National Park
and Royal Manas National park respectively. Both areas are highly biodiverse, with 
a number of charismatic and threatened species. To adequately manage the parks
to ensure conservation outcomes we quantify land use change patterns.

In conjunction with information on management practice and anthropgenic pressures
these data can be used to inform monitoring and management plans.

We first identify the two parks of interest from the WDPA dataset 
(already imported in the code editor)
