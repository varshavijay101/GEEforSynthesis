The Earth Engine data catalog contains many common datasets 
but many research projects use data obtained and stored locally

In this excercise we will use data from 
Vijay, Varsha, et al. 
"Deforestation risks posed by oil palm expansion in the Peruvian Amazon." 
Environmental Research Letters 13.11 (2018): 114010.

We will use one of the datasets describing deforestation 
inside current oil palm plantations downloaded directly 
from the Oil_palm_Peru folder in the Resources section 
of the google site for this workshop

Once you download this dataset, unzip and find 4 files:
deforestoilpalm.tif, deforestoilpalm.zip
deforestoilpalmWGS.zip, README

Look at the left menu to the side of the code editor and click

Click NEW and click image upload

Using print we can learn about the image but it is often helpful
to actually view spatial data on a map

We do this using the Map. function.
This is a good place to start exploring the Docs tab to the left
