/* The Earth Engine data catalog contains
many common datasets but what if you have 
local data you want to use?

In this excercise we will use data from 
Vijay, Varsha, et al. 
"Deforestation risks posed by oil palm expansion in the Peruvian Amazon." 
Environmental Research Letters 13.11 (2018): 114010.

Data for this paper are found on Dryad
https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.kk7hq10

But for the sake of time one of the datasets from this data repository
can be downloaded from the google site for this workshop
